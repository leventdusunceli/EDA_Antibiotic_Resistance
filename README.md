# EDA_Antibiotic_Resistance 

Bacteria strains can develop mechanisms in order to eliminate the effects of antibiotics.  This is called **antibiotic resistance** and is deemed one of the biggest threats to public health.

*Klebsiella pneumoniae* belongs to ESKAPE group pathogens, which are bacteria strains that are resistant to a number of established treatment protocols and antibiotics.  These multi-resistant strains rank among the greatest clinical challenges. 

Exploratory data analysis was performed on antibiotic resistance data of *Klebsiella pneumonia* towards 5 different treatment options in European countries, collected between 2010 and 2020.  

For convenience the analysis is presented in 2 parts.  First part consists of raw data cleaning and pre-processing and the second part consists of visualization and data analysis.  

Data was collected from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Surveillance Atlas (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/antimicrobial-resistance/surveillance-and-disease-data/data-ecdc) and can be accessed from the data folder. 

This analysis was part of a finishing project for an online Python course (https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas) and was aimed to answer 5 main questions posed by myself:
  1. What was the percentage of Aminoglycosides resistant strains in 2010 and 2020 in all countries? 
  2. How does the resistance profile against Carbapenems compare between Scandinavia and Southern Europe? 
  3. What are the resistance trends in Balkans for all treatment options? 
  4. What are the resistance trends in Central Europe for all treatment options?
